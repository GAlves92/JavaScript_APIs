# JavaScript_APIs

This project was designed to use Flask to create an API for my dataset and to serve the HTML and JavaScript required for a dashboard page. I have used Jupyter Notebook for the data cleaning and munging before moving to the Flask app. 

The Dashboard is designed to have user interactivity. It contains a dropdown, a pie chart and a bubble chart illustrating the dataset according to the dropdown choices.
